		<strong>Our Approach</strong><br />
		Our holistic, wellness-based approach utilizes a range of modalities, including Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Motivational Interviewing, Twelve-Step Philosophy, Person- Centered Therapy and Harm Reduction. We appreciate the complex factors that play a role in addiction, interfere with treatment and spur relapse.  Thus, all services promote physical, psychological, social and spiritual health and growth.<br /><br />
		
		We offer clients the guidance and encouragement required to venture outside of their comfort zones, seeking freedom, momentum and peace.  All programs focus on long-term solutions in which clients live in supervised, real-world environments.  We reject “institutionalizing” our clients, instead giving them the support and self-reliance to cope with everyday challenges and build a successful future.<br /><br />
		
		<strong>Disease vs. Dis-ease</strong><br />
		Research has shown that there are alcoholic biochemistries that predispose some people to addiction.  However, we feel that this "disease" model robs individuals of hope, and fosters discouragement. Instead, we view addiction as a "dis-ease" that causes imbalance, but can be treated and managed to create physical, psycho-emotional and spiritual balance.<br /><br />
		
		To restore wellness and "ease," we employ both best practices and innovative modalities, including: <br />
		<ul>
			<li>Motivational Interviewing</li>
			<li>Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing (E.M.D.R.) for Post Traumatic Stress and Compulsive Disorders</li>
			<li>Dialectic Behavior Therapy (D.B.T.) </li>
			<li>Hypnosis</li>
			<li>Traditional group and individual therapy</li>
		</ul><br />
		Further, we rely on our professional staff’s training and experience to address the emotional issues, childhood traumas and other significant personal and interpersonal problems that may arise during treatment and can impact addictive behavior.  Our locations across the Twin Cities help people at all stages of the treatment and recovery process, providing holistic, culturally responsive support.<br /><br />
		
		<strong>Assessment/Evaluation</strong><br />
		A comprehensive interview with an addictions counselor is the first step on the road to recovery.  AAFS offers culturally-specific adolescent and adult Rule 25 assessments. Our assessors provide prompt results, referring clients to chemical health services that best suit their needs.<br /><br />
		A Rule 25 assessment is required to access treatment services in Minnesota. Rule 25 assessment services are offered at AAFS Monday through Thursday, on a first-come, first-served basis in our Minneapolis office.  The St. Paul office also provides Rule 25 assessments and appointments can be scheduled by calling 612-871-7878.<br /><br />
		
		<strong>AAFS' Adult Outpatient Treatment</strong><br />
		This program helps individuals understand the causes of chemical dependency and work to restore wellness within self, family, and community.  We employ culturally responsive, evidence-based models, and use industry best practices grounded in African American culture.  While the program comprehensively explores societal issues such as oppression, racism, and cross-cultural ignorance, we work from the premise that giving up and waiting for society to change can create victimization.<br /><br />
		
		<strong>Women's Recovery and Wellness Enhancement</strong><br />
		This twenty-six week, case management and supportive services program supports pregnant women towards delivery of drug-free babies.  We also help women with children acquire and maintain their sobriety, enhance their parenting skills, and provide their families with supportive, sober and drug-free environments.<br /><br />
		
		<strong>Co-Occurring Disorders</strong><br />
		Among individuals who suffer a substance use disorder, up to one-half also have a co-occurring mental illness such as bipolar disorder, anxiety, or depression.  People who have co-occurring disorders are likely to experience:
		<ul>
			<li>trouble with the law</li>
			<li>family and relationship conflicts</li>
			<li>loss of housing and jobs</li>
			<li>infectious and chronic diseases</li>
			<li>risk of suicide</li>
			<li>difficulty staying in treatment</li>
			<li>chronic pain and physical health challenges</li>
		</ul><br />
		Co-occurring disorders are often undetected, so few individuals receive comprehensive treatment.  AAFS offers screening to determine the existence of co-occurring disorders, and assists clients in receiving the therapies they need to achieve holistic healing and wellness.<br /><br />
				
		<strong>Continuing Care</strong><br />
		Getting out of treatment and transitioning back into the community is only the beginning. Ongoing support is critical to a stable, sustainable, sober life for people recovering from chemical dependency.  Our continuing care services include our Transition Lecture Series, Relapse Prevention for African Americans, and support groups.<br /><br />
